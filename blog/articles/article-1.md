# Goal for this post

**_Communicate strong Mental Models for working with Large Code Bases._**

### Zooming out:

The maintainability of Design / Styling of a code base can unfortunately slip when we lack intentionality, vision, and an understanding of why. Lets appreciate some of the working rules and tools discovered in building and maintaining larger / older code bases and then try to map those successes into our own work.

David Sankel of Bloomberg has been working successfully in large code bases (tough ones too, C++) and teaching others to do the same for years.

These are some of his working mental models, do's and don't's, David appreciates that are easily mapped over into the Design.
