## Automation

Automation is leverage.

Automate what you can or you will be leveraged by those you compete with in the market place.

- Refactoring 
    - IDE resources
        - Great tooling (can you search the entire code base to find all func declarations?)
    - shell scripts
- Conventions - they were established through wisdom over time, exercise them
- Documentation - Writing code ; Writing documentation // 1 : 1
- Manual tasks - Work smart!
- Indexing - Keep a reference
