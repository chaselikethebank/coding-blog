## Standardization

- Have them, use them

"We do things the ______ way"

***Reminder***
In tech, there is rarely a better path, just different trade offs. Sometimes individuals stray from using the "_____ way" to avoid being critized for that paths weaknesses. Embrace them as 'known trade offs', and move forward with clarity, the team will respect that. 

## Naming
- Will write a post about this based on 'Clean Code' standards

## Documentaion and Leveling
- Document everything 

Make your documentation approachable by creating levels

Class/Func < Modules < Libraries < Lib Groups < Frameworks 

Leveling allows devs to get right to the source and scope... it is tough to build but will create leverage in the future. 

## K.I.S.S

'Keep it simple stupid' really lends to maintaining large code bases. 

Novel solutions lead to incorrect assumptions for those who come after you. 

There is no need to be clever in a code base. 

Absolutely no 'Cowboys'!
