## 'Draw the borders' 

- Scope: Single class / func? Several? 

## Details Matter (Strive to understand fully and precisely)
- Mnemonic Methods: Use memory aids to retain information about the code and the changes.
- Build Mental Models, name them, document them, use them, "Singleton Factory Method"

## Bullet Proof the Test
- Use the old working code to build you testing suites (unit, integration, and end to end)

## Wrapper 
- Use the new solution with the wrapper of the old code ex. class name or vice versa 

## Adoption
- Safetly and completely adapt old code to new interfaces 

## Close the loop
- Remove the old code
