## New Code = Software $

New code and/or new code paths can be easy to start but can also be tough to finish / close the loop / maintaine in the future. 

One way mitigate this 'new path' appreciation is to understand choices as 'Software Capital'

Not as a 100% rule / bias to be observed at all times, but simply to be aware of when idiating on a change. 

Said differently, it can be difficult to forecast the blindspots of a new path / direction giving the impression that 'the big change will fix evertything!', when in fact it can be tough to say. 


## Tech Debt

Hard rule - Tech Debt may not enter the code base ever. 

Not finishing something might be the riskiest way to have tech debt enter the code base. 

Designating ownership is designating responsibility; designating responsibility is awarding teams to be okay with being proud of good code and apprehensive with less than good code.
